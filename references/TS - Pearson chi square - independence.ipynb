    "To test if two nominal variables have an association, the most commonly used test is the Pearson chi-square test of independence. If the significance of this test is below 0.05, the two nominal variables have a significant association.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem though is that the Pearson chi-square test should only be used if not too many cells have a so-called expected count, of less than 5, and the minimum expected count is at least 1. So you will also have to check first if these conditions are met. Most often ‘not too many cells’ is fixed at no more than 20% of the cells. Note that there are othes who would say that all cells should have an expected count of at least 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have checked the conditions and looked at the results, you can report the test results. In the example the percentage of cells with an expected count less than 5 is actually 0%, so it is okay to use the test.\n",
